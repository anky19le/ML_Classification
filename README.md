# ML_Classification
Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluated its performance in classifying handwritten digits.
Used MNIST dataset which consists of a training set of 60000 examples and test set of 10000 examples.All digits have been 
size-normalized and centered in a fixed image of 28 Ã— 28 size. In original dataset, each pixel in the image is represented by 
an integer between 0 and 255, where 0 is black, 255 is white and anything between represents different shade of gray.
